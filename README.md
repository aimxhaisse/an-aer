# An Aer

A photography website based on [Almace Scaffolding](http://sparanoid.com/lab/amsf/) by **Tunghsiao Liu**.

## Publication Workflow

- once or twice a week, we publish an image (twitter, facebook)
- once in a while, we publish a serie (~12 images or more if specific work) (twitter, facebook, RSS)

### Series

A serie is:

- a tiny text describing the serie
- a cover image
- images

On the of the website, there is the list of published series (like
news, automated by Jekyll). On the index of the serie, there is the
list of images, also automated by Jekyll.

### Images

An image is:

- a tiny description
- a license
- metadata

Images are always published, however, they can only be accessed once
the serie is published, this allows to publish single images before
publishing the full serie.
